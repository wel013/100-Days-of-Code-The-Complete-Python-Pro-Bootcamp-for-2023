This project is a python scripts for converting from and into morse code! 
In the main.py is a script to translate both directions, but since an API was used, the rate is limited to 5
translations per hour; 

In the local_trans.py, the information is stored in a local dictionary so there is no rate limit;
But the dictionary requries manual input so it might take time to update to the full alphabet/languages 
collection; 

Future improvements: 
local_trans: 
update english alphabet

update morse code in other alphabets
